            <span>World wasted 931m tons of food waste worldwide in 2021</span>
            <p> A United Nations report reveals that the world is moving further away from its goal of ending hunger,
                food insecurity, and malnutrition in all its forms by 2030 shows that the number of people affected by
                hunger worldwide rose to as many as 828 million in 2021. This represents an increase of approximately 46
                million since 2020 and 150 million since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic.
            </p>

            <p>
                According to the Food Waste Index 2021, 931 million tons of food have been wasted worldwide, with 61%
                coming from households, 26% from food services, and 13% from retail.

                China wastes the most food, 64 kilograms per person per year, or 91,646,213 tons. The United States
                wastes 59 kilograms per person per year, or 19,359,951 tons, while Indians waste 50 kilograms per person
                per year or 68,760,163 tons.

            <p>
                Indian households rank second-highest for food wastage in the world. Are you surprised? But we can admit
                that most of us do not think twice before wasting food. Where on one hand, the homeless toil for one
                meal a day, we waste food if that does not suit our taste. According to a new survey, Indian households
                accounted for 7.4% of the entire 931 million tonnes of food wasted in the world in the world. While one
                household wasted 74kg of food each year globally, in India, the household food waste estimate is 50 kg
                per capita per year, or 68,760,163 tonnes a year. This much food is enough to feed a small country like
                Guinea.

            <p>
                74% Of Consumer-Level Food Wasted Every Year In Households
                On a global per capita-level, about 74% of consumer-level food is wasted each year in households. These
                figures are extremely alarming and food waste has substantial environmental and economic impacts. if we
                want to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, we must do our part to reduce food
                waste.
