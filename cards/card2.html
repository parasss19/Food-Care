            <span> Facts : Indian household food waste</span>


            <p>
                Indian households rank second-highest for food wastage in the world. Are you surprised? But we can admit that most
                of us do not think twice before wasting food. Where on one hand, the homeless toil for one meal a day, we waste food
                if that does not suit our taste. According to a new survey, Indian households accounted for 7.4% of the entire 931
                million tonnes of food wasted in the world in the world. While one household wasted 74kg of food each year globally,
                in India, the household food waste estimate is 50 kg per capita per year, or 68,760,163 tonnes a year. This much
                food is enough to feed a small country like Guinea.

            <p>
                74% Of Consumer-Level Food Wasted Every Year In Households On a global per capita-level, about 74% of consumer-level
                food is wasted each year in households. These figures are extremely alarming and food waste has substantial
                environmental and economic impacts. if we want to tackle climate change, biodiversity loss, and pollution, we must
                do our part to reduce food waste.

            <b>Awareness about the issue:</b>
            <p>
                Raising awareness about food waste management is crucial in order to address the
                growing problem of food waste. Here are some ways we figured out to raise
            </p>


            <p>
                1. Educate people about the impact of food waste: People may not realize the
                extent of the problem and its impact on the environment, economy, and
                society. By sharing information and statistics about food waste, our motto is to help people understand
                why it is important to take action.
            </p>

            <p>
                2. Encourage people to take action: Many people may want to reduce food waste
                but are unsure of how to do so which is why our initiative will connect with
                people who want to donate food and with people who want to join us in this
                fight against hunger by volunteering to donate food.
            </p>

            <p>
                3. Collaborate with local organizations: Collaborating with local organizations such
                as universities, community groups, social workers ,ngoâ€™s and schools can help
                raise awareness about food waste and provide opportunities for people to get
                involved.
            </p>

            <p>
                4. Use of social media: Social media can be a powerful tool for raising awareness
                and promoting action. We will Share infographics, videos, and other content
                related to food waste and our solution on social media platforms to reach a
                wider audience.
            </p>

            <p>
                5. Organize events: Organize events such as workshops, seminars, and talks to
                educate people on food waste reduction and management.
            </p>

            <p>
                6. Get Support from local initiatives that focus on food waste reduction and management,
                such as community gardens, composting projects, and food recovery programs.

            <p>
                7. Start conversations: Talk to your family, friends, and colleagues about the issue
                of food waste and share information about its impact on the environment and
                society.
            </p>

            <p>
                8 . Practice what you preach: Lead by example and practice food waste reduction
                in your own life. This will inspire others to do the same.
                By raising awareness about the issue of food waste and promoting responsible food
                consumption habits, we can all play a role in reducing food waste and promoting a
                more sustainable food system.</p>
