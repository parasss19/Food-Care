            <span> Combat food waste</span>
            <p>
                Food waste is a major global problem that has a significant impact on the environment,
                economy, and society. According to the Food and Agriculture Organization of the
                United Nations (FAO), about one-third of all food produced in the world is wasted,
                which amounts to 1.3 billion tons of food each year. Reducing food waste is essential to
                ensure that we use our resources effectively and sustainably. In this essay, we will
                discuss the importance of reducing food waste and explore some strategies to achieve
                this goal.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Firstly</b> reducing food waste is important for the environment. Food waste is a
                significant source of greenhouse gas emissions, which contribute to climate change.
                When food is thrown away, it ends up in landfills, where it decomposes and releases
                methane, a potent greenhouse gas that is 25 times more powerful than carbon dioxide.
                By reducing food waste, we can reduce greenhouse gas emissions and mitigate the
                impact of climate change.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Secondly</b> reducing food waste can have economic benefits. Food waste represents a
                significant economic loss for businesses and households. When food is wasted, the
                resources used to produce, transport, and store it are also wasted. This includes water,
                energy, and labor. By reducing food waste, we can save resources and reduce costs.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>Thirdly</b>, reducing food waste can help to address food insecurity. According to the
                FAO, if we could recover just one-fourth of the food that is currently lost or wasted, it
                would be enough to feed the 870 million people who are hungry in the world. By
                reducing food waste, we can increase the availability of food and reduce hunger.

            <span>Our Solution</span>
            <p>
                Many times you might have throwed your food into the garbage basically wasted it when it
                was present in excess or you might have intention to donate but unable to find any beggar or
                organization near you. So basically Our strategy focuses on to donate excess food to ,beggars and also animals.
            </p>

            <p>
                This can help to reduce food waste and address food insecurity at the same time by ensuring
                people have access to nutritious meal. If you have excess food that you would like to donate, it
                is important to ensure that it is safe to eat and meets food safety standards. We will also target
                a reputable organization that can accept the donation and ensure that it is distributed to those
                in need.
            </p>

            <p>
                Our idea is that By taking small steps to reduce food waste in your everyday life, you can help
                reduce the environmental impact of food waste and ensure that more people have access to
                healthy meals
